# Todo Items

An ongoing list of items that would make Americano better.

### External Resources

External resources are called **guides** in Americano.

- better way to add guides
- graceful failure of uninitialized resources
    - should not crash app
    - should reconnect on failure

### Better Bower Integration

Bower is a like `npm` but for web modules.
A bower component contains a `component.json` file that can 
be parsed in order to automatically link the component to our project.
